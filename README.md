# Rock Paper Scissors
A simple implementation of the [rock paper scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors) game.

This is an exercise for [the JavaScript Basics section](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics) of The Odin Project. The game can be played from the browser console. Each run of the game consists of 5 rounds. Winner or loser will be reported at the end.
